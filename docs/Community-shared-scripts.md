[GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/) is simple way to share (and thus find) jArchi script. Just follow these conventions:
* Your shared script must ends with .ajs (which is the default extension for jArchi scripts)
* Your description must contains the tag `#jArchi`

When done, all jArchi scripts can be find using [a simple query](https://gist.github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=%23jarchi+extension%3Aajs&ref=searchresults).
